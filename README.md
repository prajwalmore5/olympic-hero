### Project Overview

 Problem Statement:
The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, I tried to explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) ,  looked at some interesting statistics and then tried to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.

Dataframe operations

Conditional statement and loops
